## Set the system's hostname. Please note that, unless you have a local DNS
## setup where the hostname is derived from DHCP requests (as with dnsmasq),
## setting the hostname here will not make the machine reachable by this name.
## You may also wish to install avahi-daemon (see the "packages:" key below)
## to make your machine reachable by the .local domain
#hostname: ubuntu

## Set up the keyboard layout. See localectl(1), in particular the various
## list-x11-* sub-commands, to determine the available models, layouts,
## variants, and options
#keyboard:
#  model: pc105
#  layout: gb
#  variant:
#  options: ctrl:nocaps

# Enable password authentication with the SSH daemon
ssh_pwauth: true
