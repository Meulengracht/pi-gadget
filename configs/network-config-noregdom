# Please note that, at this time, there is no way to specify the wifi
# regulatory region in the netplan or cloud-init configuration (LP: #1951586),
# and the /etc/default/crda configuration file has been removed. If you need to
# specify a regulatory region, append the following to the line in
# "cmdline.txt" (adjusting "GB" to your own region):

# cfg80211.ieee80211_regdom=GB
